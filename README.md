Jot is an ultra-minimal starter site template for [GeneratePress Premium](https://mighil.com/recommends/generatepress/). It comes with an automatic dark mode for supported systems and browsers.

This template heavily relies on  prefers-color-scheme CSS media feature. Refer to my [blog post](https://mighil.com/automatic-dark-mode-for-wordpress/) if you want to read more about that.

## Key features of Jot

- Automatic dark mode. Follows Google’s best practices.
- Grayscale filter while in dark mode. Applicable to img, code, kbd, pre, samp, and blockquote.
